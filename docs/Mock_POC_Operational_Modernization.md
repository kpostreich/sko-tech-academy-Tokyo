## Operational Modernization Mock POC


### Use case scenario: 


You had conversations with your customer about the benefits of moving WebSphere ND applications from VMs to containers and deploy 
to a container-based cloud.  They liked the idea of shifting to an operational model that aligns with the new cloud native workloads 
that are also being deployed to OpenShift. 

The development team says they do not know if the application can be migrated from Traditional WebSphere to Liberty directly without 
any code changes. They are asking you for suggestion on how to move the application to cloud. 

You propose a POC to demonstrate modernizing one of their WebSphere applications by simply Rehosting the application to deploy within a WAS container, maintaining the monolith application without changes to the application or runtime



### Agenda

Allotted Time | Session / Activity 
-------|-------------------
`10 min` | **Instructor led walkthrough of mock POC requirements:** Establish the goals and expectations for this session
`5 min` | **Elect a team leader**: The team leader will deliver the playback of the mock POC solutions to instructor
`15 min` | **Application Assessments:** using TA, analyze the two provided applications, and decide which one you will modernize in this scenario
`2.25 hrs` | **Mock POC:** As a team, build the solution for the mock POC use cases
`15 min` | **Playback to instructor:** Upon completion, the team leader will showcase the POC use case solutions to instructor
 

### Team Activities for the mock POC

  - **Instructor guided** review of the DoU/POC document to understand the scope and exit requirements of each use case
  - Select a team member to deliver the playback of the successful POC use cases: **5 minutes**
   - Using the mock POC / DOU and activity guide, develop and showcase the required use cases outlined in the POC
     - Perform an assessment of the applications that are deployed on the WebSphere server on VM
	 - Identify an application that would fit for a POC for a modernization to tWAS containers deployed to OpenShift
     - Containerize and test the chosen application in local Docker containers (tWAS)
     - Deploy the chosen application to OpenShift and test it

  - One team member will playback the use case solutions to an instructor and be assessed based on a standard rubric that is used across the mock POC playbacks.
