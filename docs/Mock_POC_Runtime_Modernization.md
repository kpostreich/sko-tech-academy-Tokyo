## Runtime Modernization (Replatform) Mock POC


### Use case scenario: 

Your customer wants to move their traditional WebSphere applications to Liberty and deploy to a container-based cloud.  
However, the development team do not know where to start and which application to move to Liberty at minimum effort. 
They are asking you for suggestion on how to move one of their applications to cloud. 

You propose a POC to demonstrate modernizing one of their WebSphere applications by re-platforming the application to Liberty, containerize the application, and deploy to OpenShift container-based cloud, maintaining the monolith application. 


### Agenda

Allotted Time | Session / Activity 
-------|-------------------
`10 min` | **Instructor led walkthrough of mock POC requirements:** Establish the goals and expectations for this session
`5 min` | **Elect a team leader**: The team leader will deliver the playback of the mock POC solutions to instructor
`2.5 hours` | **Mock POC:** As a team, build the solution for the mock POC use cases
`15 min` | **Playback to instructor:** Upon completion, the team leader will showcase the POC use case solutions to instructor
 

### Team Activities for the mock POC

 - **Instructor guided** review of the DoU/POC document to understand the scope and exit requirements of each use case
   - Select a team member to deliver the playback of the successful POC use cases: **5 minutes**
   - Using the mock POC / DOU and activity guide, develop and showcase the required use cases outlined in the POC
     - Perform an assessment of the applications that are deployed on the WebSphere server on VM
	 - Identify an application that would fit for a POC for a modernization to tWAS containers deployed to OpenShift
     - Containerize and test the chosen application in local Docker containers (tWAS)
     - Deploy the chosen application to OpenShift and test it

  - One team member will playback the use case solutions to an instructor and be assessed based on a standard rubric that is used across the mock POC playbacks.
