### Use case scenario: 

Your customer has shown interest in modernizing some of their existing WebSphere applications to take advantage of container-based clouds. 
They have an existing portfolio of Java applications that run on WebSphere ND in virtual machines.  
However, they need help from IBM to define an optimal modernization path for the specific applications. 

You propose a workshop / POC to use IBM Transformation Advisor to assess their application inventory to provide insights into the applications. Using the insights gained from TA, you interpret the results for the customer, provide recommendations for modernization journey, and propose what a POC would like for one of the applications assessed.
