## IBM WebSphere Automation Mock POC


### Use case scenario:Â 

You had conversations with your customer. There is a high priority Log4J vulnerability and he is worried that their WebSphere estate is affected. 
The executives want to know if servers are affected, which ones, how long they have been exposed and how to resolve the vulnerabilities. 

You already demoed WebSphere Automation and proposed a POC to demonstrate WebSphere Automation Security in their environment.


### Agenda

Allotted Time | Session / Activity 
-------|-------------------
`15 min` | **Instructor led walkthrough of mock POC requirements:** Establish the goals and expectations for this session
`5 min` | **Elect a team leader**: The team leader will deliver the playback of the mock POC solutions to instructor
`205 min` | **Access the lab environments:** Each team has access to their own OSCP cluster and a VM, both on IBM Cloud 
`3 hours` | **Mock POC:** As a team, work develop the solution for the mock POC use cases
`15 min` | **Playback to instructor:** Upon completion, the team leader will showcase the poc use case solutions to instructor
 

### Team Activities for the mock POC

  - **Instructor guided** review of the DoU/PoC document to understand the scope and exit requirements of each use case
  - Select a team member to deliver the playback of the successful POC use cases: **5 minutes**
   - Using the mock POC / DOU and activity guide, develop and showcase the required use cases outlined in the POC

    - WebSphere Automation Alert notifications
    - Integration with two WAS server (8.5.5.15 and 9.0.5.7)
    - Security vulnerability resolution
    - Security posture of WebSphere estate, fix history, CVE state, installed fixes, etc
    - Audit reporting
  - One team member will playback the use case solutions to an instructor and be assessed based on a standard rubric that is used across the mock POC playbacks.
